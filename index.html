            My name is Erfan Eivazi. I started programming with <strong>C</strong> at high school in 2009. After
            graduating from university in 2017, I went through the Web world, and fully
            immerse myself in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and its technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, I'm a full stack <strong>web developer</strong> that prefer to work in <strong>server side</strong>.
            I try to study software development best practices, and improve my skills day by day to make better products.
        </p>
        <p>
            I really love linux and its community, and my favorite distro is
            <strong>Linux Mint</strong>, Based on Ubuntu, because of its stability, rich repository and active community.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's so interesting for me to contribute to <strong>open source</strong> projects
            on <a href="https://github.com/eerFun">Github</a> whenever I have free time or face with a
            problem while using a library. Moreover, developing
            <strong>IoTs</strong> and programming <strong>embedded systems</strong> is an enjoyable hobby for me.
        </p>
